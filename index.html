    <h1>6th International Symposium on Advanced Vehicle Technology 2023</h1>
      <p dir="auto">Because automotive research and development combine a wide range of advanced technology, it is necessary to coordinate industry, government and academia. In addition, it is also important to strengthen the cooperation between universities that are actively implementing the automotive related research. For this reason, the first ISAVT brought together five universities with centers for automotive research to help foster future collaboration. Since 2019 the network was extended to 11 international universities.</p>
      <p dir="auto">The International Symposium on Advanced Vehicle Technology (ISAVT) is an international conference discussing cooperation between industry, government, and academia for innovation in research and development and creation of new businesses, particularly in the automotive field.</p>
      <p dir="auto">The sixth international symposium will continue to develop and strengthen the cooperation between an international collection of universities and foster exchange beyond national borders between researchers in various automotive research fields. As a group, we also would like to encourage young researchers to be involved with our activity and contribute to their future success in the world.</p>
